# Background
This project is a pytorch project of the algorithm FCD-GAN. Fully Convolutional Change Detection Framework with Generative Adversarial Network (FCD-GAN) is a newly proposed framework for change detection in multi-temporal remote sensing images. The corresponding publication can be found in the following citation:

In this project, three demo codes are released for unsupervised, weakly supervised and regional supervised change detection, as "Demo_USSS", "Demo_WSSS", and "Demo_RSSS".
